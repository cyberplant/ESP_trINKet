ESP32 E-Ink Developement Board

This design was an experiment using an E-Ink display. Another PCB revision is on the way that should allowing it to be powered from a battery. Right now it can only be powered using a microUSB cable.

The programmer board is located at: https://github.com/mike-rankin/ESP32_Programmer

The enclosure designed in Fusion360 is located here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2675865

Special thanks to:
Drew at OSH Park for supplying the PCB @pdp7
and @drewler for re-writing the Waveshare library so it will work on the BuyDisplay hardware

The code right now does a hardware test verifying the display, sensors and wifi are functional. If you manage to create something of your own I would love to see it by reaching me at @mikerankin
